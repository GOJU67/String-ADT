This repository features a comprehensive implementation of a String class built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The projectâ€™s goal is to create a robust and flexible string manipulation library, providing users with a wide array of functionalities for managing and working with strings efficiently.

Features
Object-Oriented Design: Built with OOP principles to encapsulate string operations, ensuring modularity and code reusability within a dedicated class.
Custom Implementation: A unique approach to string handling that offers optimized performance and specialized functionalities beyond standard string libraries.
Rich Functionality: Includes a variety of methods for string manipulation, such as insertion, deletion, trimming, conversion, and comparison, with further extensions planned.
Extensibility: The class is designed to be easily extendable, allowing developers to add new features and functionalities over time to enhance its capabilities.
